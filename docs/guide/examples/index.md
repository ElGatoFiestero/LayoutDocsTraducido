    The examples might give pieces of `JSON` that you can use. This `JSON` refers to the [diffed json](../../definitions.md#diffing-diffed-json) generated by the SwitchThemeInjector or SwitchLayoutEditor **unless stated otherwise**. It does not refer to json generated by [3DSKit](../../extras/tools.md#theming-tools) **by default**.
