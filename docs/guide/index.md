# Introduction

## Getting Started

For this guide it is expected that you already have basic knowledge on how to install themes. If you don't, it is recommended to read [this page](https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/extras/theming/) to at least get a basic idea of what you're getting yourself into ;P

### What You'll Need

-   A hacked Switch
-   A computer
-   [The NXThemes Installer](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector/releases/latest)
-   [LayoutKit](https://github.com/ThemezerNX/LayoutKit/releases/latest)
    -   LayoutKit requires a Windows installation. While this guide might refer to LayoutKit, everything should be doable without it.
    -   [sys-ftpd with reboot support](https://github.com/ThemezerNX/sys-ftpd-light-reboot/releases/latest)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! Info
    LayoutKit comes packed with the most-used tools. If you are unable to or don't want to use LayoutKit, see [this list of other tools](../extras/tools.md).

## Initial Setup

1. Make sure the NXThemes Installer is working and you're running version â‰¥2.6.2.
2. Open the NXThemes Installer at least once so that the menus are extracted.
3. Copy the `SD://themes/systemData` folder to your computer.
4. Download and install LayoutKit.
