# Getting Started

It is recommend to make a mockup first, so you know at what position you want all elements to be! Starting without one
often results in messy layouts!

## Figuring Out the Coordinates

Even though the Switch Toolbox can visualise many things, you'll never be able to see the exact final result. It is
recommended to always start with a mockup in your favorite image editor (e.g. Photoshop or Paint.net).
