# Animations

When editing animations it's important to add new groups instead of using the ones already in the `bflyt`. This means that if you want to animate a group that's already in the layout you have to clone and rename it and use the renamed one for your animations. Note that only groups inside of the RootGroup are supported (you don't really need them outside anyways).

[This tool guide](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox/wiki/BFLYT-Editing#animations) shows how you can create animations.  
[This guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NXThemes/comments/biu5hc/making_your_own_custom_animations/) shows how you have to implement the groups so that the animations work with the Switch Theme Injector
