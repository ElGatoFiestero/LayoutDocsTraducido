# Welcome to Layout Docs!

!!! Warning
    If you're looking for a guide on how to create a theme, this is not the right place. This guide is specifically for the process of creating custom *layouts*: the actual layout of menu components. The difference is that a layout can be used in many themes. For example, [these themes](https://themezer.net/themes/homemenu?sort=updated&order=desc&layouts=e) all use [Doge Layout](https://themezer.net/layouts/homemenu/Doge-Layout-e).
